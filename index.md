## Short Biography [<a href="https://yinchangchang.github.io/CY_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>]

I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University (OSU). I'm fortunately working with Prof. [Ping Zhang](https://www.pingzhang.net/) in AIMed (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) Lab. My research interests lie in data mining, machine learning and their application to trustworthy AI (e.g., fairness and causal inference), computational medicine (e.g., predictive modeling, patient subtyping and medical imaging).
